<!-- The document object is part of the DOM (Document Object Model) and represents the entire HTML document. It allows you to access and manipulate all elements within that document.
You can use methods on the 'document' object to interact with these parent comments. For example:
If you want to insert a reply form after a parent comment when a user clicks a "Reply" button, you would use 'document.getElementById()' to select the parent comment element and then use methods like 'insertAdjacentHTML()' to add new content (like a reply form) immediately after it. -->
